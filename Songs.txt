   Author: A king is born/ Tom Inglis

A King is born this day in Bethlehem Hallelujah!|
No crown is worn but angels worship Him Halle, hallelujah!||
Almighty God, so meek, so mild Salvation comes through this holy Child.||

A King is born, (He is in the manger now)A King is born,(humbly come and humbly bow)
A tiny Lord, (reaching out a tiny hand)| A King is born this day, in Bethlehem||

His palace is lowly His throne is made of hay Hallelujah! (Halle hallelujah)
The shepherds bow down to see His holy face Halle, hallelujah!||
Heaven is singing of peace on earth Filled with the wonder of this birth

Come humbly and humbly bow He’s in the manger now 
A King is born,|A King is born||
A tiny Lord,||A King is born this day in Bethlehem||
This day in Bethlehem|This day in Bethlehem.||

   Theme: Church: Evangelism;

[E]I stand among the [E]millions[E2], and I can't help but [F#m7]feel so small,||
For I am just a speck of [D]dust, a particle existing on this great big [E]spinning ball.[Esus]||
The part of me that's [E]human[E2], it tells me I am [F#m7]not that strong,||
There's a power in my [D]soul, greater than us all, and I'm reminded I am [E]not my [EsusE]own.

I'm [D2]yielded to a [C#m]higher calling: I'm...||
[E]One voice, shining through the darkest [C#m7]night.||
One voice, standing up for what is [A2]right.||
One voice, nothing more and nothing [F#m7]less,||
Than a [D]voice crying out, a voice in the wilder[E]ness.

[E]The voices of con[E]fusion[E2], can fill a world that's [F#m7]all my own.||
Running havoc through my [D]mind, all the truth and all the lies,||
It's so hard to sift the [E]right from wrong.[Esus]||
In the middle of the [E]choosing,[E2] through the clutter of this [F#m7]human noise,||
When my words fall to the [D]ground, all the dust has settled down,||
All that matters is Your [E]still small [Esus]voice.[E]

Teach me [D]some melodious [A]sonnet, Sung by [G]flaming tongues [D]above;||
Praise the [D]mount, I'm fixed u[A]pon it, Mount of [G]Thy redeeming [D]love.||

O Lord my God!
When I in awesome wonder||
Consider all the works thy hand hath made,||
I see the stars; 
I hear the mighty thunder,||
Thy power throughout the universe displayed;||
Then sings my soul,
My saviour God,to thee,||
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art!||
When through the woods 
And forest glades I wander||
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;||
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,||
I hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze;||
Then sings my soul,
My saviour God,to thee,||
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art!||
And when I think that God his son not sparing,
Sent him to die,I scarce can take it in,||
That on the cross my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sins:||
Then sings my soul,
My saviour God,to thee,||
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art!||
When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation||
And take me home what joy shall feel my heart!||
Then shall I bow in humble adoration; ||
And there proclaim,
My God how great Thou Art!||
Then sings my soul,
My saviour God,to thee,||
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art!||

21. Romans 12
   Author: Unknown Author

Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God,
to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice,
acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.||
And do not be conformed to this world,
but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,
so that you may prove what the will of God is,
that which is good and acceptable and perfect.||
For through the grace given to me I say to everyone
among you not to think more highly of himself
than he ought to think;
but to think so as to have sound judgment,
as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.||
For just as we have many members in one body
and all the members do not have the same function,
so we, who are many, are one body in Christ,
and individually members one of another.||
Since we have gifts that differ according to
the grace given to us,
each of us is to exercise them accordingly:||
if prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith;
if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching;
or he who exhorts, in his exhortation;||
he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence;
he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.||
Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil;
cling to what is good.
Be devoted to one another in brotherly love;
give preference to one another in honor;||
not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit,
serving the Lord; rejoicing in hope,
persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer,
contributing to the needs of the saints,
practicing hospitality.||
Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.
Be of the same mind toward one another;||
do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly.
Do not be wise in your own estimation.||
Never pay back evil for evil to anyone.
Respect what is right in the sight of all men.
If possible, so far as it depends on you,
be at peace with all men.||
Never take your own revenge, beloved,
but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written,
"VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY," says the Lord.||
"BUT IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY, FEED HIM,
AND IF HE IS THIRSTY, GIVE HIM A DRINK;
FOR IN SO DOING YOU WILL HEAP BURNING COALS ON HIS HEAD."||
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

81. Apostles Creed.
   Author: Unknown Author

I believe in God, 
the Father Almighty, 
Creator of heaven and earth. 
I believe in Jesus Christ, 
His only son, 
our Lord.

He was conceived 
By the power of the 
Holy Spirit, 
And born of a virgin, Mary. 
He suffered under 
Pontius Pilate,

He was crucified, 
Died and was buried. 
He descended to the dead. 
On the third day 
he rose again.

He ascended into Heaven 
And is seated 
at the right hand 
Of the Father.

He will come 
again to judge 
The living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit, 
The Holy Catholic church, 
The communion of saints,

The forgiveness of sins, 
The resurrection of the body 
And the life everlasting. 
Amen.

Alas And Did My Saviour Bleed 
And Did My Sovereign Die? 
Would He Devote That Sacred Head 
For Sinners Such As I

At The Cross, At Cross 
Where I First Saw The Light,
And The Burden Of My Heart Rolled Away,
It Was There By Faith I Received My Sight,
And Now I Am Happy All The Day!

Was It For Crimes That I Have Done
He Groaned On The Tree? 
Amazing Pity! Grace Unknown
And Love Beyond Degree!

But Drops Of Grief Can Ne'er Repay
The Debt Of Love I Owe:
Here, Lord, I Give Myself Away ‘Tis All That I Can Do

With [D]Wisdom, [A]Pow’r, And Love, |Our[Bm7] God Is An[C#m7] Awesome[F#m] God.

And when the [F#m]sky was starless in the void of the night,
Our [Bm7]God is an [C#m7]awesome [F#m]God.
He spoke into the darkness and created the light,
Our [Bm7]God is an [C#m7]awesome [F#m]God.||
[Bm7]Judgment and wrath He poured out on Sodom,
[C#m7]Mercy and grace He [Bm7]gave us at the [F#m]cross;
I [D]hope that we have not [D/B]too quickly for[D/F#]gotten that
Our [Bm7]God is an [C#m7]awesome [F#m]God.

   Author: Unknown Author

I Set Out On A Narrow Way Many Years Ago||
Hoping I Would Find True Love Along The Broken Road||
But I Got Lost A Time Or Two||
Wiped My Brow And Kept Pushing Through||
I Couldn't See How Every Sign Pointed Straight To You

Every Long Lost Dream Led Me To Where You Are||
Others Who Broke My Heart They Were Like Northern Stars||
Pointing Me On My Way Into Your Loving Arms||
This Much I Know Is True||
That God Blessed The Broken Road||
That Led Me Straight To You

I Think About The Years I Spent Just Passing Through||
I'd Like To Have The Time I Lost And Give It Back To You||
But You Just Smile And Take My Hand||
You've Been There You Understand||
It's All Part Of A Grander Plan That Is Coming True

Now I'm Just Rolling Home||
Into My Lover's Arms||
This Much I Know Is True||
That God Blessed The Broken Road||
That Led Me Straight To You

That God Blessed The Broken Road||

176. Christ is enough for me.
   Author: HILLSONG

Christ is my reward
And all of my devotion
Now there's nothing in this world
That could ever satisfy||

Through every trial
My soul will sing
No turning back
I've been set free||
Christ is enough for me
Christ is enough for me
Everything I need is in You
Everything I need

Christ my all in all
The joy of my salvation
And this hope will never fail
Heaven is our home

Through every storm
My soul will sing
Jesus is here
To God be the glory

I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back
No turning back||
The cross before me
The world behind me
No turning back
No turning back

   Author: Unknown Author

I am weak, but Thou art strong;
Jesus, keep me from all wrong;
I’ll be satisfied as long||
As I walk, let me walk 
close to Thee.

Just a closer walk with Thee,
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea,
Daily walking close to Thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

Through this world of toil 
and snares,
If I falter, Lord, 
who cares?||
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, 
none but Thee.

Just a closer walk with Thee,
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea,
Daily walking close to Thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

When my feeble life is o’er,
Time for me will be no more;
||Guide me gently, safely o’er
To Thy kingdom shore, 
to Thy shore.

Just a closer walk with Thee,
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea,
Daily walking close to Thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

I am thine o lord|
I have heard your voice||

And be closer |drawn to thee

Draw me nearer|
To the cross where |thou has died||
Draw me nearer|
To your precious |bleeding side||
Draw me nearer|
Draw me nearer

Consecrate me now|
To your service lord||
By the power of grace divine||
Let my soul know calm||
With a steady hope|
And my will be lost in thine

There are depths of love|
That I cannot go||
Till I cross the narrow sea|
There are heights of joy||
That I may not reach|
Till I rest in peace with thee

330. God Is Working His Purpose Out
   Author: Unknown Author

From utmost east to utmost west,
Where’er man’s foot hath trod,
By the mouth of many messengers
Goes forth the voice of God;||
Give ear to me, ye continents,
Ye isles, give ear to me,
That the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.

March we forth in the strength of God
With the banner of Christ unfurled,
That the light of the glorious gospel of truth
May shine throughout the world:||
Fight we the fight with sorrow and sin
To set their captives free,
That the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.

All we can do is nothing worth
Unless God blesses the deed;
Vainly we hope for the harvest tide
Till God gives life to the seed;||
Yet nearer and nearer draws the time,
The time that shall surely be,
When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.

Whenever I Consider Just Where|| God Brought Me From
The Life Of Emptiness| I Lived Without God’s Son||
My Heart Cries “Hallelujah,” |‘Cause The Saviour |Rescued Me||
Without His Precious Love |Where Would I Be?

I Would Be Lost| I Would Be Drifting |Like A Ship On Stormy Seas||
Without The Sacrifice| That Jesus’ Life Affords ||
I Would Be Dead Within |My Sin|Forever Longing To Be Free||
If It Had Not Been |For The Goodness |Of The Lord||
If It Had Not Been |For The Goodness |Of The Lord

Since |The Day He Saved Me|| Just Look Where |I’ve Come From||
I’m Now Being Made Into| The Likeness Of God’s Son||
I Have This Blessed Assurance| Since The Saviour Rescued Me||
Without His Precious Love| Where Would I Be?

I Would Be Lost| I Would Be Drifting |Like A Ship On Stormy Seas||
Without The Sacrifice| That Jesus’ Life Affords ||
I Would Be Dead Within |My Sin|Forever Longing To Be Free||
If It Had Not Been |For The Goodness |Of The Lord||
If It Had Not Been |For The Goodness |Of The Lord|| 
If It Had Not Been |For The Goodness |Of The Lord

Jesus Brought Me |Out Of Darkness |Into His Marvelous Light|| And Placed Me |On A Solid Rock To Stay||
And Now I’m Walking| With My Saviour|| And I’m Fighting |The Good Fight|| Because Of Jesus I Can Truly Say

I Would Be Lost| I Would Be Drifting |Like A Ship On Stormy Seas||
Without The Sacrifice| That Jesus’ Life Affords ||
I Would Be Dead Within |My Sin|Forever Longing To Be Free||
If It Had Not Been |For The Goodness |Of The Lord||
If It Had Not Been |For The Goodness |Of The Lord||

The Goodness Of The Lord |He Picked Me Up|| And Turned My World |Around Yes, He Did||
The Goodness Of The Lord |He Washed Me |With His Precious Blood||
The Goodness Of The Lord |He Filled My Heart |With Hope And Love||
He Saved Me, He Raised Me|He Kept Me||
If It Had Not Been |For The Goodness |Of The Lord||

   Author: Unknown Author

On this day of happiness
We have gathered here to bless||
The union of two lives in holy love
Love's blossoming is now expressed||
In solemn vows and promises
With flowers and golden rings||
A wedding dress
We look around with joy to see||
The smiles of friends and family
As witness to his day||
But, best of all, a guest unseen
Is here with us and, once again
Water turns to wine, ooooh|

On this thier wedding day
We ask you Lord to stay||
And by your Spirit
Join these hearts together||
And from this moment on
Teach them your Lover's song||
That all the world may hear a three part harmony|

Oh may this song of Love ring clear
Through health or sickness, joy or tears||
For as long as both of them shall live
May they hamonize with heaven above||
Stay tuned to the key of love
Keep their eyes on Jesus day by day||
And may the music of their days
Become a symphony of praise||
In honour of their lord
And maythe song become a dance|| 
To celebrate the great romance
of jesus and his bride

Oh Lord my [A2]God, when I in [D]awesome wonder
Consider [A2]all the [E]worlds Thy [Bm]hands have [A2]made;
I see the stars, I hear the [D]rolling thunder:
Thy pow'r through[A2]out the [E]uni[Bm]verse dis[A2]played.

Then sings my [A2]soul my [D]Savior God to [A2]Thee,
How great Thou [E]art, how great Thou [A2]art;
Then sings my soul my [D]Savior God to [A2]Thee,
How great Thou [E]art[Bm], how great Thou [A2]art.

When through the [A2]woods, and forest [D]glades I wander,
And hear the [A2]birds sing [E]sweetly [Bm]in the [A2]trees;
When I look down from lofty [D]mountain grandeur,
And hear the b[A2]rook and [E]feel the [Bm]gentle [A2]breeze.

Then sings my [A2]soul my [D]Savior God to [A2]Thee,
How great Thou [E]art, how great Thou [A2]art;
Then sings my soul my [D]Savior God to [A2]Thee,
How great Thou [E]art[Bm], how great Thou [A2]art.

And when I [A2]think that God, His [D]Son not sparing
Sent Him to [A2]die, I [E]scarce can [Bm]take it [A2]in;
That on the cross, my burden [D]gladly bearing,
He bled and d[A2]ied to [E]take a[Bm]way my [A2]sin.

Then sings my [A2]soul my [D]Savior God to [A2]Thee,
How great Thou [E]art, how great Thou [A2]art;
Then sings my soul my [D]Savior God to [A2]Thee,
How great Thou [E]art[Bm], how great Thou [A2]art.

When Christ shall [A2]come with shout of [D]acclamation
And take me [A2]home, what [E]joy shall [Bm]fill my [A2]heart;
Then I shall bow in humble [D]adoration,
And there proc[A2]laim my [E]God how [Bm]great Thou [A2]art!

Then sings my [A2]soul my [D]Savior God to [A2]Thee,
How great Thou [E]art, how great Thou [A2]art;
Then sings my soul my [D]Savior God to [A2]Thee,
How great Thou [E]art[Bm], how great Thou [A2]art.

And now that I know
the truth that You proclaim ooh – ooh,||
I will keep trusting You
to fill me up, ‘til only You remain||
And I will not rest until my every word
brings glory to Your Name,||
With all that I’m
all that I do, 
I live for You

Only You can save me
from the debt I had to pay||
So now I want to tell the world||
the difference You have made||
You have changed the way I live and love
and made my heart brand new||
Now that we have are joined together||
I know am nothing without You

And now that I know
the truth that You proclaim ooh – ooh,||
I will keep trusting You
to fill me up, ‘til only You remains||
And I will not rest until my every word, 
brings glory to Your Name||
All that I am,
all that I do||
All of my life,
I live for You

496. I Pledge Allegiance.
   Author: Unknown Author

I have heard how Christians 
long ago 
Were brought before 
a tyrants throne

They were told that 
he would spare their lives 
If they would renounce 
The name of Christ,

But one by one, 
they chose to die 
The Son of God,

They would not deny 
Like a great angelic choir sings 
I can almost hear their voices 
ring.

I pledge allegiance 
to the Lamb With all 
my strength, 
with all I am

I will seek to honor 
His commands 
I pledge allegiance to 
The Lamb.

Now, the years have come 
and the years have gone 
And the 'cause of Jesus 
still goes on

Now, our time has come 
to count the cost 
To reject this world, 
to embrace the Cross,

And one by one let us live 
our lives 
For the One who died to 
give us life

Till the trumpet sounds 
on the final day 
Let us proudly stand and 
boldly say.

I pledge allegiance 
to the Lamb With all 
my strength, 
with all I am

I will seek to honor 
His commands 
I pledge allegiance to 
The Lamb.

To the Lamb of God 
who bore my pain 
Who took my place,

who wore my shame 
I will seek to 
honor His commands 
I pledge allegiance to the 
Lamb,

   Author: Unknown Author

I stand amazed 
in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,||
And wonder how 
He could love me,
A sinner, condemned, 
unclean.

O how marvelous! 
O how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:||
O how marvelous! 
O how wonderful!
Is my Savior's love for me!

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;||
He bore the burden to Calvary,
And suffered and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,||
’Twill be my joy 
through the ages
To sing of His love for me.

And I will rise when He calls my name

Before my God fall on my knees
And rise

There's a day that's drawing near
When this darkness breaks to light
And the shadows disappear
And my faith shall be my eyes
Jesus has overcome
And the grave is overwhelmed
The victory is won
He is risen from the dead

And I will rise when He calls my name
No more sorrow, no more pain
I will rise on eagles' wings
Before my God fall on my knees
And rise
I will rise
And I hear the voice of many angels sing,
"Worthy is the Lamb"
And I hear the cry of every longing heart,
"Worthy is the Lamb"

And I will rise when He calls my name
No more sorrow, no more pain
I will rise on eagles' wings
Before my God fall on my knees
And rise
I will rise

   Author: Unknown Author

You unravel me, with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance, from my enemies
Till all my fears are gone

I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

I am a child of God

From my mothers womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I've been born again, into your family
Your blood flows through my veins

(x2)

I am surrounded
By the arms of the Father
I am surrounded
By songs of deliverance
We've been liberated
From our bondage
We're the sons and the daughters
Let us sing our freedom

You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
My fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me
and I will stand and sing
I am a child of God

I am a Child of God

Imagine me
Loving what I see when the mirror 
looks at me 'cause I
I imagine me||
In a place of no insecurities
And I'm finally happy 'cause
I imagine me

Letting go of all of 
the ones who hurt me
'Cause they never did deserve me
Can you imagine me?||
Saying "No" to thoughts 
that try to control me
Remembering all you told me
Lord, can you imagine me?

Over what my mama said
And healed from 
what my daddy did
I wanna live and not 
read that page again

Imagine me being free, 
trusting you totally
Finally I can...
Imagine me||
I admit it was hard to see
You being in love 
with someone like me
But finally I can...
Imagine me

(Imagine me) Being strong
And not letting people 
break me down
You won't get that joy 
this time around (No no)||
Can you imagine me?
In a world (in a world) 
where nobody has to live afraid
Because of your love 
fear's gone away
Can you imagine me?

Letting go of my past
And glad I have another chance
And my heart will dance
'Cause I don't have to read 
that page again

(Imagine me)
Imagine me, me being free, 
trusting you totally
Finally I can...
Imagine me
(I admit Jesus)|| 
I admit it was hard to see
You being in love with 
someone like me (like me)
Finally I can...
Imagine me

(I imagine me)
Imagine me (being free) being free, 
trusting you totally (totally)
Finally I can...
Imagine me||
(I'll be honest with you)
I admit it was hard to see 
(it was hard)
You being in love with 
someone like me (yeah)
But finally I can...
Imagine me

When I think upon your goodness
And your faithfulness each day
I’m convinced it’s not because I am worthy
To receive the kind of love that you give

But I’m grateful for your mercy
And I’m grateful for your grace
And because of how you’ve poured out yourself
I have come to sing out in praise

Imela! Imela! Okaka, Onyekeruwa
(Thank you! Thank you! Great and Mighty Creater of the world)
Imela! Imela! Eze M Oh
(Thank you! Thank you! My King!)

Who am I to sing your praises?
Who am I to worship you?
It’s your blood that makes the difference in me
And made a way to enter into your throne

I could not come near your presence
I could never sing your song
But the sacrifice on Calvary’s tree
Is the reason I can cry out today

Imela! Imela! Okaka, Onyekeruwa

In Christ Alone My Hope Is Found
He Is My Light My Strength, My Song||

Fullness Of God In Helpless Babe
This Gift Of Love And Righteousness|| 
Scorned By The Ones He Came To Save 
‘Til On That Cross As Jesus Died 
The Wrath Of God Was Satisfied|| 
For Every Sin On Him Was Laid 
Here In The Death Of Christ I Live

There In The Ground His Body Lay 
Light Of The World By Darkness Slain|| 
Then Bursting Forth In Glorious Day
Up From The Grave He Rose Again 
And As He Stands In Victory ||
Sin’s Curse Has Lost Its Grip On Me
For I Am His And He Is Mine ||
Bought With The Precious Blood Of Christ

No Guilt In Life No Fear In Death 
This Is The Power Of Christ In Me|| 
From Life’s First Cry To Final Breath
Jesus Commands My Destiny ||
No Power Of Hell No Scheme Of Man
Can Ever Pluck Me From His Hand
‘Til He Returns Or Calls Me Home
Here In The Power |Of Christ I’ll Stand

I [G]come to the garden alone, While the [C]dew is still on the [G]roses;
And the [D]voice I hear falling [G]on my ear, The [A7]Son of God dis[D]closes.

And He [G]walks with me, and He [D]talks with me,
And He [C]tells me [D7]I am His [G]own;
And the [G]joy we [B7]share as we [Em]tarry [C]there,
None [G]other has [D7]ever [G]known.

He [G]speaks, and the sound of His voice Is so [C]sweet the birds hush their [G]singing;
And the [D]melody that He [G]gave to me, With[A7]in my heart is [D]ringing.

And He [G]walks with me, and He [D]talks with me,
And He [C]tells me [D7]I am His [G]own;
And the [G]joy we [B7]share as we [Em]tarry [C]there,
None [G]other has [D7]ever [G]known.

I'd [G]stay in the garden with Him, Though the [C]night around me be [G]falling;
But He [D]bids me go; thru the [G]voice of woe, His [A7]voice to me is [D]calling.

And He [G]walks with me, and He [D]talks with me,
And He [C]tells me [D7]I am His [G]own;
And the [G]joy we [B7]share as we [Em]tarry [C]there,
None [G]other has [D7]ever [G]known.

561. It Is Well, With My Soul.
   Author: Unknown Author

When Peace Like A River
Attendeth My Way,
When Sorrows Like Sea
Billows Roll||
Whatever My Lot,
Thou Hast Taught
Me To Say, It Is Well
It Is Well With My Soul;

It Is Well With My Soul
It Is Well, It Is Well 
With My Soul;

Though Satan Should
Buffet, Though Trials
Should Come, Let This
Blessed Assurance||
Control, That Christ Has
Regarded My Helpless
Estate And Has Shed His
Own Blood For My Soul;

It Is Well With My Soul
It Is Well, It Is Well 
With My Soul

My Sin, Oh The Bliss
Of This Glorious Thought
My Sin, No In Part
But The Whole||
Is Nailed To The Cross
And I Bear It No More
Praise The Lord
Praise The Lord O My Soul;

It Is Well With My Soul
It Is Well, It Is Well 
With My Soul;

For me, be it christ, be it
Christ hence to live;
If Jordan above me shall roll,||
No pang shall be mine, 
for in death as in life,
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace,
to my soul.

It Is Well With My Soul
It Is Well, It Is Well 
With My Soul;

But Lord, 'tis for Thee, for,
Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, 
is our goal;||
Oh, trump of the angel,
Oh voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope, blessed rest
of my soul!

It Is Well With My Soul
It Is Well, It Is Well 
With My Soul;

And Lord Haste The Day
When The Faith Shall
Be Sight, The Clouds Be
Rolled Back As A Scroll||
The Trump Shall Resound
And The Lord Shall
Descend Even So
It Is Well With My Soul.

It Is Well With My Soul
It Is Well, It Is Well 
With My Soul.

   Author: Unknown Author

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible said,
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas Day.

While shepherds watch their flocks by night,
they see a bright new shining star,
they hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.//

For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out
there were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted
"let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace".//

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn,
and in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.//

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ was born on Christmas Day.//

Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out
there were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted
"let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace".//

Oh my Lord
You sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord
Your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord
That sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more//

Oh my Lord
when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord
A golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord
They gathered all around him
To see him and adore//

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)
They had become to doubt you
Oh my Lord (He is the truth forever)
What did they know about you
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)
But they were lost without you
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)//

Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)
with the child's adoration
Oh my lord (He is a personation)
There came great jubilation
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)
And full of admiration
They realized what they had (until the sun falls from the sky)//

Oh my Lord (Oh praise the Lord)
You sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord (This day will live forever)
Your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)
That sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more //

Amazing grace! 
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind but now I see.

My chains are gone
I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing grace

‘Twas grace that taught
My heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

My chains are gone
I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing grace

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.

My chains are gone
I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing grace

Through many dangers,
Toils and snares,
I have already come;
‘Tis grace hath brought me
Safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

My chains are gone
I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing grace

When we’ve been there
Ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days
To sing God’s praise
Than when we’d first begun.

My chains are gone
I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing grace

<b>I believe in one God
The Father Almighty
Maker of heaven and earth
And all that is visible and invisible</b>

<b>I believe in Jesus Christ
The only Son of God
Eternally begotten of the Father
God from God, Light from light
True God from true God</b>

<b>Begotten not made
One in being with the Father
Through Him all things were made
For us men and for our salvation</b>

<b>He came down from heaven
By the power of the Holy Spirit
He was born of the virgin Mary
And became man</b>

<b>For our sake, He was crucified
Under Pontius Pilate
He suffered, Died and was buried</b>

<b>On the third day 
He rose again
In fulfillment of the scriptures</b>

<b>He ascended into heaven
And is seated at the right 
hand of the Father</b>

<b>He will come again in glory
To judge the living and the dead
And His Kingdom will have no end</b>

<b>I believe in the Holy Spirit
The Lord and the giver of Life
Who proceeds from the 
Father and the Son</b>

<b>Who with the father and the son 
is worshipped and glorified
And He spoke through the Prophets</b>

<b>I believe in one, Holy, Catholic 
And Apostolic Church
I acknowledge one baptism
For the forgiveness of sins</b>

<b>I look forward 
to the resurrection of the dead
And the life of 
the world to come, 
Amen</b>

   Author: Unknown Author

The first Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay:
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far:
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel.

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from the country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew nigh to the north-west;
O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the kind of Israel.

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven and earth of naught,
And with his blood mankind has bought.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

Oh Lord Jesus turn 
Your eyes upon me
For I know there is 
mercy in Your sight

Your statutes are 
my heritage forever
My heart is set on

So still my anxious 
urge toward rebellion
And let love keep 
my will on its knees

Oh God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You
Oh God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You

To all creation 
I can see a limit
But Your commands 
are boundless and have none||
So Your Word is 
my joy and meditation
From the rising to 
the setting of the sun

All Your ways are 
loving and are faithful
The road is narrow 
but Your burden light||
Because You gladly 
lean to lead the humble
I shall gladly 
kneel to leave my pride

Oh God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You
Oh God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You

I will seek You 
in the morning
I will learn to 
walk in Your ways||
And step by step 
You'll lead me
And I will follow 
You all of my days

My Hope Is Built On Nothingless
Than Jesus' Blood And Righteousness
I Dare Not Trust The Sweetest Frame
But Wholly Lean On Jesus’ Name

On Christ The Solid Rock I Stand
All Other Ground Is Sinking Sand
All Other Ground Is Sinking Sand

When Darkness Veils His Lovely Face
I Rest On His Unchanging Grace
In Every High And Stormy Gale
My Anchor Holds Within The Veil

His Oath His Covenant His Blood
Support Me In The Whelming Flood
When All Around My Soul Gives Way
He Then Is All My Hope And Stay

When He Shall Come With Trumpet Sound
O May I Then In Him Be Found
Dressed In His Righteousness Alone
Faultless To Stand Before The Throne

   Author: Unknown Author

Pass me not, 
O gentle Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;||
While on others 
Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Saviour, Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;||
While on others 
Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Let me at Thy 
throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief,||
Kneeling there in 
deep contrition;
Help my unbelief.

Saviour, Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;||
While on others 
Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Trusting only in 
Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;||
Heal my wounded, 
broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

Saviour, Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;||
While on others 
Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Thou the Spring of 
all my comfort,
More than life to me,||
Whom have I on earth 
beside Thee?
Whom in heaven 
but Thee?

Saviour, Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;||
While on others 
Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Rock of ages cleft for me
Let me hide myself in thee
Let the water and the blood
From thy river side which flowed
Be of sin the double cure
Cleanse me from this guilt and power

Not the labour of my hands
Can fulfil thy laws demands
Could my zeal no respite know
Could my tears for ever flow
All for sin could not atone
Though must save and though alone

Nothing in my hands I bring
Simply to thy cross I cling
Naked come to thee for dress
Helpless look to thee for grace
Foul i to the fountain fly
Wash me Saviour or i die

While I draw this fleeting breathe
When my eyelids close in death
When I soar through tracks unknown
See thee on thy judgement throne
Rock of ages cleft for me
Let me hide myself in thee

Oh that [A]old rugged cross, so de[D]spised by the world, Has a [E7]wondrous attraction for [A]me;
For the [A]dear Lamb of God left His [A]glory above, To [E7]bear it to dark Calva[A]ry.

In the [A]old rugged cross, stained with [D]blood so divine, A [E7]wondrous beauty I [A]see;
For twas [A]on that old cross Jesus [D]suffered and died, To [E7]pardon and sanctify [A]me.

To the [A]old rugged cross I will [D]ever be true, Its [E7]shame and reproach gladly [A]bear;

   Author: Unknown Author

O Lord my God, 
When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds 
Thy Hands have made;

I see the stars, 
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout 
the universe displayed.

Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art.

When through the woods, 
and forest glades I wander,
And hear the birds sing 
sweetly in the trees.

When I look down, 
from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook, 
and feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think of God, 
His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die, 
I scarce can take it in;

That on the Cross, 
my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died 
to take away my sin.

When Christ shall come, 
with shout of acclamation,
And take me home, 
what joy shall fill my heart.

Then I shall bow, 
in humble adoration,
And then proclaim: 
"My God, how great Thou art!"

988. THIS WORLD IS NOT MY HOME.
   Author: Albert E. Brumley.

This world is not my home 
I'm just a passing through 
My treasures are laid up 
somewhere beyond the blue|| 
The angels beckon me 
from heaven's open door 
And I can't feel at home in 
this world anymore.

Oh Lord You know 
I have no friend like You 
If heaven's not my home 
then Lord what will I do|| 
The angels beckon me 
from heaven's open door 
And I can't feel at home 
in this world anymore.

I have a loving mother 
just up in Gloryland 
And I don't expect to stop until|| 
I shake her hand She's waiting 
now for me in heaven's open door 
And I can't feel at home 
in this world anymore.

Oh Lord You know 
I have no friend like You 
If heaven's not my home 
then Lord what will I do|| 
The angels beckon me 
from heaven's open door 
And I can't feel at home 
in this world anymore.

Just over in Gloryland 
we'll live eternaly 
the saints on every hand 
are shouting victory|| 
Their songs of sweetest praise drift 
back from heaven's shore 
And I can't feel at home 
in this world anymore.

Oh Lord You know 
I have no friend like You 
If heaven's not my home 
then Lord what will I do|| 
The angels beckon me 
from heaven's open door 
And I can't feel at home 
in this world anymore.

Seems To All Come Crashing Down||
And Everything I Wanna Trust
Is Giving In To Doubt||
When All I Hold Sacred
Is Anything But Sound||
I Will Lift My Eyes To You
And Find That You’ve |Never Moved

Somehow |In Spite Of It All
You Will Not Be Shaken||
Somewhere Above It All
You Are King
And You Remain Unchanged

So Much That |I Can’t Control||
So Much That |I Can’t Reach||
The Only Think I Really Know 
Is You’re Everything I Need ||
And I Don’t Wanna |Put My Hope
In Temporary Things||
I Will Lift My Eyes To You
Knowing You’ll Never Move

When Everything Is Shaking
Everything Is Breaking||
I Need Something |To Put My Faith In
It Can Only Be You||
Somehow, I Will Lift My Eyes |To You

   Theme: Christ: Love/Mercy; Fruit: Peace/Comfort;

What a friend we have in Jesus, 
All ours sins and griefs to bear;
What a privilege to carry, 
Everything to God in prayer!

O what peace we often forfeit, 
O what needless pain we bear;
All because we do not carry, 
Everything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations? 
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged, 
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Can we find a friend so faithful? 
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness; 
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden, 
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour still our refuge; 
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Do thy friends despise forsake thee? 
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In His arms He’ll take and shield thee; 
Thou wilt find a solace there.

Pouring out the oil of love
As my worship to You.

my every part;||
Lord, 
receive the sacrifice 
Of a broken heart

Jesus, what can I give,

To so faithful a friend,||

Savior, what can be said, 
what can be sung

As a praise of Your name
For the things 
You have done?||
Oh my words 
could not tell, 
not even in part||
Of the debt of 
love that is owed
By this thankful heart

You deserve 
my every breath
For You’ve 
paid the great cost;||
Giving up 
Your life to death,
Even death on a cross

You took all 
my shame away,
There defeated my sin||
Opened up the 
gates of heaven
And have beckoned me in.

Jesus, what can I give,
what can I bring
To so faithful a friend,||
to so loving a King?
Savior, what can be said,

Oh my words

1077. When God Made You
   Author: Newsong and Natalie Grant

It's always been a mystery in me||
How two hearts can come together||
And love can last forever||
But now that I have found you| I believe||
That a miracle has come||
When God sends the perfect One||
Now gone are all my questions about why||
And I've never been so sure| of anything in my life|

Oh, I wonder what God was thinking|| 
When He created you||
I wonder if He|knew everything I would need||
Because He made all my dreams come true|| 
When God made you||
He must have been thinking about me|

I promise that wherever you may go||
Wherever life may lead you||
With all my heart| I'll be there too||
And from this moment on| I want you to know||
I'll let nothing come between us||
And I will love the ones you love||
Now gone are all my questions about why||
And I've never been so sure|of anything in my life|

I wonder what God was thinking|| 
When He created you||
I wonder if He|knew everything I would need||
Because He made all my dreams come true||
When God made you||
He must have been thinking about me|

He made the sun| He made the moon||
To harmonize a perfect tune||
One can't move without the other||
They just have to be together||
And that is why| I know it's true||
You're for me and I'm for You||
'Cause my world just can't be right||
Without you in my life|

I wonder what God was thinking|| 
When He created you||
I wonder if He|knew everything I would need||
Because He made all my dreams come true||
He must've heard every prayer| I've been praying||
Yes, He knew everything I would need||
When God made you||
When dreams come true||
When God made you||
He must've been thinking about me|

Almighty God |The Great I Am||
Immovable Rock |Omnipotent, Powerful |Awesome Lord||
Victorious Warrior| Commanding King Of Kings| Mighty Conqueror || 
And The Only Time| The Only Time I Ever Saw |Him Run Was When . . .

He Ran To Me |He Took Me In His Arms |Held My Head To His Chest||
Said "My Son's Come |Home Again!" ||Lifted My Face |Wiped The Tears |From My Eyes||
With Forgiveness |In His Voice He Said|| "Son, Do You Know |I Still Love You?"||
He Caught Me By Surprise |When God Ran . . .

The Day I Left Home |I Knew I'd Broken |His Heart||
And I Wondered Then |If Things Could Ever Be |The Same||
Then One Night |I Remembered His Love |For Me||
And Down That Dusty Road |Ahead I Could See||
It Was The Only Time |It Was The Only Time |I Ever Saw Him Run And Then . . .

He Ran To Me |He Took Me In His Arms |Held My Head To His Chest||
Said "My Son's Come| Home Again!" ||Lifted My Face |Wiped The Tears |From My Eyes||
With Forgiveness |In His Voice He Said|| "Son, Do You Know |I Still Love You?"||
He Caught Me By Surprise |And He Brought Me |To My Knees||
When God Ran . . . |I Saw Him Run To Me

I Was So Ashamed |All Alone And So Far Away||
But Now I Know That |He's Been Waiting |For This Day||
I Saw Him Run To Me |He Took Me In His Arms |Held My Head To His Chest||
Said "My Son's Come |Home Again!"||Lifted My Face |Wiped The Tears |From My Eyes||
With Forgiveness |In His Voice|| I Felt His Love For Me |Again||
He Ran To Me |He Took Me In His Arms |Held My Head To His Chest||
Said "My Son's Come |Home Again!"||
Lifted My Face |Wiped The Tears |From My Eyes||
With Forgiveness |In His Voice|| 
He Said "Son" |He Called Me Son||
He Said |"Son, Do You Know |I Still Love You?"||
He Ran To Me |(When God Ran)|(I Saw Him Run To Me)||

   Author: Unknown Author

When I Survey The Wondrous Cross
On Which The Prince of Glory Died 
My Richest Gain I Count But Loss
And Pour Contempt On All My Pride

Forbid It Lord That I Should Boast
Save In The Death Of Christ My Lord
All The Vain Things That Charm Me Most
I Sacrifice Them To His Blood

See From His Head His Hands, His Feet
Sorrow And Love Flow Mingled Down
Did E'er Such Love And Sorrow Meet
Or Thorns Compose So Rich A Crown

Were The Whole Realm Of Nature Mine
That Were An Offering Far Too Small, 
Love So Amazing So Divine 
Demands My Soul, My Life, My All

When the music fades,
All is stripped away
And I simply come.||
Longing just to bring
Something that’s of worth
That will bless your heart.

I’ll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required.|| 
You search much deeper within, 
through the way things appear, 
you’re looking into my heart.

I’m Coming back to you 
with a heart of worship
And Its all about you, 
All about you Jesus

I’m Sorry Lord for The 
Thing I’ve made it
When Its All about you
All About You Jesus.

King of endless worth
No One could express
How Much you deserve||
Though I’m weak And Poor
All I have is yours
Every single Breath

I’ll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required.|| 
You search much deeper within, 
through the way things appear, 
you’re looking into my heart.

I’m Coming back to you

You don't have to worry
And don't you be afraid
Joy comes in the morning

And if your heart is broken
Just lift your hands and say

Oh

No matter what may come my way
My life is in your hands

With Jesus I can take it
With Him I know I can stand
No matter what may come my way
My life is in your hands

So when your tests and trials
They seem to get you down
And all your friends and loved ones
Are nowhere to be found

Remember there's a friend in Jesus
Who will wipe your tears away
And if you heart is broken
Just lift your hands and say

Oh
I know that I can make it
I know that I can stand
No matter what may come my way
My life is in your hands

With Jesus I can take it
With Him I know I can stand
No matter what may come my way
My life is in your hands

Yesu alifuga wonna,
Wonna omusana we gwaka,
Obwakabaka bwe bulibuna,
Okutuusa ennaku zonna.

Abantu b'ennimi zonna,
Batendenga okwagala kwe,
Abaana banaabuuliranga,
Obulungi bw'erinnya lye.

Omukisa gwe  bwe guli,
Abasibe bafuna eddembe,
Abakooye banaawummulanga,
Abeetaaga ne bakkuta

Buli muntu ayimirire, 
Atende nnyo Kabaka we,
Bamalayika ne bayimba,
Ensi n'eddamu Amiina.

1.KATONDA eyannonda nze,
Si lwa bulunge bwange,
Eyannonda obulonzi,

N’anzigyako ebibi,
Nnyinza ntya okumalayo,
Ebbanja lyange eryenkanaawo?

2.Yanzigya mu balabe,
N’anfuula omwana we,
Yanzigya mu bujeemu,

N’anfuula omutukuvu,
Nyinza ntya okumalayo
Ebbanja lyange eryenkanaawo?

3.Bwe ndituuka mu ggulu,
Olw’obutuukirivu,
Obwa Yesu, si bwange,

Bwe ndiraba amaaso ge,
Ne ndyoka ntegeereraawo,
Ebbanja bwe litaggwaayo.

That we worship one God in trinity and the trinity in unity, neither blending their persons nor dividing their essence.

For the person of the Father is a distinct person, the person of the Son is another, and that of the Holy Spirit still another.

But the divinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is one, their glory equal, their majesty coeternal.
